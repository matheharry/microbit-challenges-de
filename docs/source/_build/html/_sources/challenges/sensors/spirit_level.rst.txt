A spirit level, like the one in the picture above, is used to tell whether a surface is flat. If you put a spirit level on a flat surface the bubble will rest in the 
middle of the tube. If the surface is tilted to the left or right, the bubble will also move to the left or right indicating visually that there is a slope. You can use accelerometer
values to determine whether the micro:bit is on a flat surface or not and give the user a signal by displaying an arrow, for example, to indicate a tilt.
